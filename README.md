Develop dynamic website with python django backend and push to repo and make it live using Aws/Google Cloud on www.justgetit.in/filmscm
github.com/just-get-it/filmSCM
Clone using django python
It's private It's just a blank repo if this website taking time in cloning? if so we can change the website...as its just a template...dont try to find photos/media files for website as can not able to get it as it may be in backend. Also animation for website is time consuming. So can you change the clone website, We don't need their pics and animation, Only need their template to replace content provided by us using content avaialble on google drive database containing backend data and pics generally are hidden rest u can clone For all pics and animation, put same common reference under media folder Use ctrl+find Nd replace all by common any one dummy pic and animation text and pics/video/animations we will share later.....once required.. text. pics.video/animation, etcafter clone ref wont work due to ref file missing that u have to fix by replacing the ref to dummy any one common pic/animation
