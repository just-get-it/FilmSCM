Clone using django python
This repo is private and is just a blank repo.
if this website taking time in cloning, we can change the website...as its just a template for referance...if media files are not getting clone due to its location in the weckend of website...dont try to find photos/media files for website as can not able to get it as it may be in backend. 
Also animation for website may be time consuming. So can you replace these from the clone website, We don't need their pics/video and animation if any issue in cloning, 
Only need their template to replace content provided by us using content avaialble on google drive link above mentiined, containing backend data and pics generally are hidden rest u can clone For all pics and animation, put same common reference under media folder .
Use ctrl+find and replace all by common pic - any one dummy pic and animation text and pics/video/animations we will share later.....once required.. text. pics.video/animation, etc after clone ref wont work due to ref file missing that u have to fix by replacing the ref to dummy any one common pic/animation
